Our project being a **patent search engine** is a tool for improving the intellect of the person exploring the types of intellectual property. We did this by importing the **European Patent Office (EPO) API** so we can abstract a large patent database searching process quickly and properly. With the help of **HTML** and **CSS** used in the frontend, a user-friendly interface is provided, while the backend, a program that uses **Python FLASK**, ensures the smooth data processing and the API integration. This combination not only ensures a very secure and seamless patent discovery platform but also provides a very user-friendly and user-centric experience.
